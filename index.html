		<legend>python</legend>
		<p>is developed by Guido van Rossum. Guido van Rossum started implementing Python in 1989. Python is a very simple programming language so even if you are new to programming, you can learn python without facing any issues.</p>
	<h1>Interesting fact: </h1>
	<p>Python is named after the comedy television show Monty Python’s Flying Circus. It is not named after the Python snake.</p>
	<ol>
		<h1>There are so many applications of Python :</h1>
		<li>. Web development
		<p>Web framework like Django and Flask are based on Python. They help you write server side code which helps you manage database, write backend programming logic, mapping urls etc.</p></li>
		<li>Machine learning
		<p>There are many machine learning applications written in Python. Machine learning is a way to write a logic so that a machine can learn and solve a particular problem on its own. For example, products recommendation in websites like Amazon, Flipkart, eBay etc. is a machine learning algorithm that recognises user’s interest. Face recognition and Voice recognition in your phone is another example of machine learning</p></li>
		<li>Data Analysis
		<p>Data analysis and data visualisation in form of charts can also be developed using Python.</p></li>
		<li>Scripting
		<p>Scripting is writing small programs to automate simple tasks such as sending automated response emails etc. Such type of applications can also be written in Python programming language</p></li>
		<li>Game development
		<p>You can develop games using Python</p></li>
		<li>. You can develop Embedded applications in Python.</li>
		<li>Desktop applications
		<p>Desktop applications – You can develop desktop application in Python using library like TKinter or QT.</p></li>
