        <h1>Basic Python syntax:</h1>
        <p>Basic syntaxes can be referred to as simple guidelines that every programming language requires. Let's try to understand from our daily lives. Let's say you can't eat your food without having it dressed and placed properly on the platter. You need to have proper dressing of food before you can consume it. You prepare a special drink comprising three measures of Gordon gin, one of vodka, half of Kina Lillet, and follow the process to mix in steps. The process is necessary to have a perfect blend. These are sort of syntaxes when we talk in terms of programming languages.</p>
        <h1>Python Identifiers</h1>
		<p>Apart from keywords, a Python program can have variables, functions, classes, modules, packages etc. Identifier is the name given to these programming elements. An identifier should start with either an alphabet letter (lower or upper case) or an underscore (_). After that, more than one alphabet letters (a-z or A-Z), digits (0-9) or underscores may be used to form an identifier. No other characters are allowed.

Conventionally, the name of the class begins with an uppercase alphabet letter. Others start with lowercase alphabet letters.
Use of one or two underscore characters has a special significance when naming the instance attributes of a class. More about this will follow in the discussion about inheritance.
Two leading and trailing underscores are used in the language itself for a special purpose. For example (e.g. __add__, __init__)</p>
